This Github Repository contains all solutions to Leetcode-style Problems I have solved so far. 
I am currently following the Neetcode 150 roadmap, but will keep expanding to other problems!
The main languages I am using to solve leetcode questions are Java and Python.

Here is a current list of all the problems that have been solved, some of these are non-Leetcode, so they will be marked as such 
if they are not. Additionally, this will say whether the problem has been solved in Python, Java, or Both.
